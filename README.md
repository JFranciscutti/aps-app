# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# IMPORTANT NOTE
The backend of this project was made with Java 11, SpringBoot and MySQL for the database. As it is a local project, you are able to see just the login screen (because of the backend calls that won't work in your computer).

# Unless you do the following ;-)
 - Clone this repo
 - Make sure that you have a MySQL client running in your PC
 - Create a database called 'aps_project'.
 - OPTIONAL: create a database, no matter the name. Then, go to application.properties file in the backend folder and reaplace 'aps_project' with your database name in the selected line of this image.

- After that, you should be able to run the backend app.

# Lifting up the frontend!
- Move to the root of this project and run 'npm install' to install all dependencies.
- Then, run 'npm start'.

Congratulations, if you followed the steps correctly, you are able to:
### DESTROY THE WHOLE APP

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
